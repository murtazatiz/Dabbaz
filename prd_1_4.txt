Tiffin Marketplace Platform
 
Product Requirements Document
 
 
Version 1.3  |  February 2026  |  Confidential 
MVP —  Single City Launch 
 
 
1. Executive Summary 
Dabbaz is a two-sided marketplace platform connecting home tiffin and meal service providers 
(vendors) with customers who want reliable, home-cooked daily meal subscriptions. Think of it 
as Zomato, but purpose-built for the subscription-based dabba economy —  designed for 
working professionals, students, and families who want wholesome meals without the overhead 
of cooking or the cost of restaurant dining. 
 
The platform serves three distinct stakeholders: customers who discover, subscribe to, and 
manage tiffin deliveries; vendors (home chefs, tiffin operators, cloud kitchens) who manage their 
menus, subscriptions, and finances through a dedicated dashboard; and platform administrators 
who oversee onboarding, approvals, payments, and overall ecosystem health. 
 
This document outlines the full product requirements for the Dabbaz MVP, targeting a single-city 
launch. Delivery logistics are handled by vendors themselves —  Dabbaz does not operate its 
own delivery fleet in this phase.

2. Assumptions & Constraints 
2.1 Key Assumptions 
•     Delivery Model: Vendors are responsible for their own delivery. Dabbaz does not 
manage delivery partners in the MVP. 
•     Geography: Single-city MVP launch. Multi-city support is a future phase. 
•     Platform Name: Dabbaz (brand guidelines to be provided separately; visual design 
tokens to be updated post-handoff). 
•     Language: English for MVP. Vernacular language support is a Phase 2 consideration.  
•     Payments: Platform-managed; vendors receive payouts on a defined settlement cycle. 
Razorpay or Stripe India recommended as payment gateway. 
 
2.2 Out of Scope (MVP) 
•     Platform-managed delivery / delivery partner module 
•     Multi-city / multi-region support 
•     Native mobile apps (iOS / Android) —  MVP is mobile-responsive web; app is Phase 2 
•     In-app chat between users and vendors 
•     AI-powered recommendations or personalization engine  
•     Third-party integrations (Swiggy, Zomato aggregator APIs)  
 
 
3. Goals & Success Metrics 
3.1 Product Goals 
•     G1 —  Trust & Transparency: Make it easy for users to evaluate vendors through 
verified profiles, ratings, and standardized menus before committing to a subscription.  
•     G2 —  Vendor Empowerment: Give vendors full control over their menu, pricing, 
delivery windows, and subscription offerings through an intuitive admin dashboard, with 
zero need for external tools.  
•     G3 —  Retention-First Subscriptions: Reduce subscription churn through flexible 
pause/skip mechanics, proactive notifications, and transparent credit/refund handling.  
•     G4 —  Platform Integrity: Prevent spam vendor registrations and ensure only legitimate, 
verified operators are onboarded.  
 
3.2 Success Metrics (6 months post-launch) 
Metric                                       Target                             Notes

Key Features Used: Platform admin dashboard, vendor review queue, user management, 
dispute handling, payout management. 
 
 
5. Feature Specifications 
5.1 Authentication & User Management 
5.1.1 Sign Up & Login 
Users and vendors share a single auth entry point. Account creation is a byproduct of checkout 
—  not a prerequisite to browsing or adding to cart. 
•     Primary Authentication —  Phone + OTP: The main way users log in and register. User 
enters their mobile number, receives a 6-digit OTP via SMS (MSG91), enters it, and is 
authenticated. If no account exists for that number, one is created automatically in the 
same step. No password is ever set or required. Returning users log in the same way —  
phone number → OTP → done. This is the default flow for all customers who come 
through the cart-first journey. 
•     Alternative Authentication —  Google OAuth 2.0: Users can sign in with their Google 
account as an alternative to phone+OTP. On first Google sign-in, an account is created 
using the Google email and name. The user is then prompted to add and verify a phone 
number before they can place an order (phone is required for delivery coordination). 
•     No Email + Password: Email and password-based auth is not offered. This removes 
password management complexity and aligns with how most Indian consumer apps 
authenticate users. 
•     Session Management: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens. Access token expires in 
15 minutes; refresh token valid for 30 days. Stored in localStorage on the frontend. 
•     Account Deletion: Users can request account deletion from profile settings; data is soft-
deleted for 30 days before permanent removal. 
 
5.1.2 Role System 
•     CUSTOMER —  Default role created on first OTP verification or Google sign-in. Can 
browse, add to cart, subscribe, manage deliveries. 
•     VENDOR —  Assigned after successful onboarding approval. Gets access to vendor 
dashboard. 
•     ADMIN —  Internal only. Assigned manually by super-admin. Full platform access. 
 
5.2 Vendor Onboarding & Verification 
5.2.1 Onboarding Request Flow 
Any logged-in user can submit a vendor onboarding request. The flow is multi-step to gather 
necessary information and filter out low-effort or spam submissions.

Confidential  |  v1.4  |  Feb 2026                                                                                                                         Page 
 
•     Step 1 —  Eligibility Check: User must have a verified email and a verified mobile 
number (OTP to phone required before proceeding). This is the primary anti-spam gate. 
•     Step 2 —  Business Details Form: Business/kitchen name, contact person name, 
address, PIN code, years of operation, approximate current daily capacity (number of 
tiffins). 
•     Step 3 —  Document Upload: FSSAI license (mandatory), a government ID of 
proprietor, and optionally a kitchen hygiene certificate. Files are validated for format and 
size. 
•     Step 4 —  Sample Menu Submission: A brief description of typical meals offered (text + 
optional photos). Helps admin evaluate before calling. 
•     Step 5 —  Declaration & Submit: Checkbox confirming accuracy of information. 
reCAPTCHA v3 score evaluated server-side. 
 
5.2.2 Anti-Spam Measures 
•     Phone OTP verification (Twilio / MSG91) mandatory —  one verified phone per vendor 
application. 
•     reCAPTCHA v3 on submission —  requests with low scores are flagged for manual 
review. 
•     Duplicate detection: same phone number or FSSAI number cannot be submitted twice. 
•     Rate limiting: maximum 3 onboarding submissions per IP per 24 hours. 
•     Application fee consideration (Phase 2): a nominal refundable INR 99 application fee as 
a future friction layer. 
 
5.2.3 Admin Review & Approval 
•     All applications land in the Admin's Vendor Review Queue with a status of PENDING. 
•     Admin can view all submitted details and documents, and change status to: 
APPROVED, REJECTED, or NEEDS_MORE_INFO. 
•     On APPROVED: vendor account type is upgraded, a welcome email is sent with a 
getting-started guide, and the vendor dashboard is unlocked. 
•     On REJECTED: rejection reason is sent via email. The same phone number is blocked 
from re-applying for 30 days. 
•     On NEEDS_MORE_INFO: applicant receives an email with specific items to resubmit. 
Application is not closed. 
 
5.3 Vendor Profile & Customer Discovery 
5.3.1 Vendor Public Profile 
Each approved vendor gets a public profile page that serves as their storefront on Dabbaz. 
•     About Section: Kitchen story, who's cooking, years of experience, specialties. Rich text 
editor in the vendor dashboard. 
•     Cuisine Tags: Multi-select tags such as North Indian, South Indian, Jain, Bengali, etc.

•     Veg / Non-Veg / Both Indicator: Prominently displayed green/brown badge on profile 
card and listing. 
•     FSSAI Verified Badge: Shown once document is confirmed by admin. Trust signal for 
users. 
•     Delivery Areas: Vendor specifies deliverable PIN codes or neighbourhoods. This is 
used for filtering on the discovery page. 
•     Delivery Windows: Separate configurable time ranges for Lunch (e.g., 12:00 PM – 1:30 
PM) and Dinner (e.g., 7:30 PM – 9:00 PM). Shown as informational for users. 
•     Daily Capacity Cap: Vendor sets a maximum number of tiffins they can fulfill per day 
(e.g., 25). Once active subscriptions reach this cap, the Subscribe button is disabled and 
the listing shows a 'Full —  Not Accepting New Subscribers' badge. The cap can be 
updated at any time from the vendor dashboard, and increasing it immediately re-opens 
subscriptions. 
•     Photos: Up to 8 food photos. First photo is the cover image on listing cards. 
•     Ratings & Reviews: Aggregate star rating, total review count, and paginated reviews 
with user name, date, and comment. 
 
5.3.2 Discovery & Filtering 
•     Home page shows vendor listing cards sorted by rating (default). 
•     Filters: Veg / Non-Veg / Both; Delivery Area (PIN code entry or neighbourhood 
dropdown); Meal Type (Lunch / Dinner / Both); Price Range; Cuisine Tags; Available 
Only (hides vendors at capacity). 
•     Search bar: full-text search across vendor name, cuisine tags, and about text. 
•     Vendor cards show: name, cover photo, cuisine tags, veg/non-veg badge, star rating, 
starting price, delivery areas. Cards at full capacity show a 'Full' badge and the 
Subscribe button is replaced with a greyed-out 'At Capacity' indicator. 
 
5.4 Standardized Menu Management (Calendar Format) 
5.4.1 Overview 
Vendors set their menu in a weekly calendar view. This gives users full visibility into what they 
will receive on any given day before subscribing —  a core trust and differentiation feature. 
 
5.4.2 Menu Builder (Vendor Dashboard) 
•     Calendar View: A 7-column (Mon–Sun) grid. Vendors can toggle between Lunch and 
Dinner menus using a tab. 
•     Day Cell: Each cell shows the meal name, a short description (up to 120 characters), 
meal type badge (Veg/Non-Veg), and an optional photo. 
•     Add / Edit Meal: Clicking a day cell opens a slide-over panel to set: Meal Name, 
Description, Veg/Non-Veg toggle, Photo upload, Addons available for that day. 
•     Recurring Templates: Vendor can save a week as a template and apply it to future 
weeks. Reduces repetitive entry.

•     Holiday / Full Day Off: Vendor can mark a specific day as entirely closed (no lunch, no 
dinner). These days are shown to users as 'Off' with no charge against their 
subscription. 
•     Slot-Level Disabling: Independently of a full off-day, vendors can disable just Lunch or 
just Dinner on any given day. For example: mark Wednesday lunch as unavailable while 
still serving dinner. This is more granular than a full off-day and reflects how real home 
kitchens operate. Disabled slots show to users as 'Not available today' and are not 
charged. 
•     Publish / Draft: Menu for any given week can be saved as Draft until the vendor is 
ready to publish. Published menus are visible to subscribers immediately. 
•     Advance Planning: Vendors can plan up to 8 weeks ahead. Menu for the current week 
must be published by a configurable cutoff (default: Sunday 11:59 PM for the upcoming 
week). 
 
5.4.3 Addons 
•     Addon Definition: Vendors define a global addon list (e.g., Extra Roti x2, Sweet of the 
Day, Raita, Extra Dal). Each has a name, price, and veg/non-veg flag. 
•     Day-Level Addon Availability: When editing a day's meal, the vendor toggles which 
global addons are available that day. 
•     User Addon Selection: Users can select addons per day from their subscription 
management screen. Addon charges are added to the next billing cycle or invoiced 
separately based on configuration. 
 
5.4.4 User-Facing Menu View 
•     Users see a read-only version of the same weekly calendar on the vendor's profile. 
•     They can scroll forward/backward by week. Future weeks show 'Menu not yet published' 
if unpublished. 
•     Each day cell is expandable to show full meal details and available addons. 
 
5.5 Subscription Plans (Phase 2 —  Not in MVP) 
Recurring subscription plans are deferred to Phase 2. The MVP is built entirely on the cart 
model —  users pick specific days and pay once per order. The database schema retains the 
Subscription, SubscriptionPlan, and related tables so Phase 2 can be built on top without 
schema migrations. 
Phase 2 subscription features will include: recurring plan configuration by vendors, minimum 
duration enforcement, pause/skip/cancel with credit rollover, auto-renewal, and active 
subscriber management. All of these are documented in the schema for forward compatibility 
but no UI or API routes are built for them in the MVP. 
 
5.6 Payment Architecture 
5.6.1 Payment Methods 
----------------Page (6) Break----------------

•     Payment Gateway: Razorpay for India, supporting UPI, Credit/Debit Cards, and Net 
Banking. 
•     Cart Checkout Payment: User is charged the full cart total in a single Razorpay 
transaction. No recurring billing in MVP. 
•     Payment Method Selection: At checkout, user chooses one of three options —  Wallet 
(if balance covers full order amount), Card/Net Banking, or UPI. Wallet is only selectable 
if the balance covers the full order total. Partial wallet payment is not supported in MVP. 
•     Failed Payment Handling: If payment fails or user drops off from Razorpay, the cart is 
preserved entirely. A fresh Razorpay order is created on retry. Razorpay order link 
expires after 15 minutes of inactivity. Cart is only cleared on confirmed successful 
payment. 
•     Payment Receipt: Automated email receipt sent to customer on every successful 
payment. Contains itemised order summary. 
 
5.6.2 Platform Wallet 
•     Wallet Purpose: The wallet is a credit store for each user. In MVP its primary purpose is 
to receive refund credits from order cancellations and admin-issued complaint refunds. 
Users can also use their wallet balance to pay for orders. 
•     Wallet Top-Up Toggle: A global admin switch controls whether users can load money 
into their wallet. When ON: users can top up via Razorpay and use the wallet as an 
alternative payment method. When OFF: no new top-ups, but existing balance remains 
spendable and the wallet continues to receive refund credits. 
•     Wallet Balance Display: Always visible on the customer dashboard and checkout page 
regardless of toggle state. 
•     Wallet Transaction Categories: Every wallet credit or debit is tagged with a category 
for transparency in the customer's wallet history: 
•     TOP_UP —  user manually loaded money into wallet (only when toggle is ON) 
•     CANCELLATION_CREDIT —  customer cancelled a day's delivery before the 9 PM 
cutoff. Amount = meal price minus the configurable cancellation fee. Tagged with the 
specific order and date. 
•     VENDOR_CANCELLATION_CREDIT —  vendor marked a day as Off after customer 
had already paid. Full meal amount credited, no cancellation fee deducted. 
•     REFUND_COMPLAINT —  admin manually issued a credit following a customer 
complaint. Tagged with the complaint context. 
•     PAYMENT_DEBIT —  wallet used to pay for an order. 
 
5.6.3 Cancellation Fee 
•     Structure: A globally configurable flat fee (set in admin Platform Config, e.g. ₹20) is 
deducted from the meal price when a customer cancels a day's delivery. The fee 
represents platform revenue. Example: meal priced at ₹150, cancellation fee ₹20, 
customer receives ₹130 as CANCELLATION_CREDIT. 
•     Vendor-initiated Day Off: No cancellation fee applies. Customer receives the full meal 
amount as VENDOR_CANCELLATION_CREDIT.

5.6.4 Vendor Payouts (Phase 2) 
Vendor payout architecture, commission splits, Razorpay Route configuration, and the payout 
dashboard are deferred to Phase 2. The payment model (platform-collected vs vendor-direct) is 
a pending business decision. For MVP, vendor settlements are handled manually. 
 
5.7 Delivery & Notifications 
5.7.1 MVP Delivery Model 
Vendors handle delivery themselves. Dabbaz does not provide GPS tracking or a courier 
network. The delivery coordination in MVP is intentionally lightweight —  the vendor dispatches 
the order and triggers a notification to the customer. No further status granularity is required for 
launch. 
•     Dispatch Action: Vendor opens their daily order list on the dashboard and clicks 'Mark 
as Dispatched' per order. This is the only delivery status action in MVP. 
•     Customer Notification on Dispatch: When vendor clicks dispatch, the system 
immediately sends the customer: (1) a WhatsApp message via Interakt/Wati using a pre-
approved template (e.g., 'Your tiffin from [Vendor Name] is on its way!'), and (2) an email 
via Resend as fallback. Both fire simultaneously. 
•     Order Freeze at 9 PM: Each night at 9 PM IST, the system freezes all orders for the 
following day. After 9 PM, customers cannot cancel or modify the next day's delivery. 
The cutoff time (9 PM) is configurable from the admin Platform Config panel. 
•     Phase 2 Delivery Features: In-app delivery status tracking (Preparing → Out for 
Delivery → Delivered → Not Delivered), WhatsApp notifications to vendors on new 
orders and cancellations, and consolidated daily delivery count view for vendors are all 
deferred to Phase 2. 
 
5.7.2 MVP Notification Events 
Event                                        Recipient                        Channel (MVP)

5.8 Ratings & Reviews (Phase 2 —  Not in MVP)

The ratings and reviews system is deferred to Phase 2. Users need a history of orders before 
reviews are meaningful. The Review table exists in the schema for future use. 
 
5.9 Meal Preferences & Dietary Customization (Phase 2 —  Not in MVP) 
Detailed dietary preference profiles, vendor accommodation flags, and per-order allergy notes 
are deferred to Phase 2. For MVP, vendors can include dietary information in their menu item 
descriptions. Customers can add a free-text delivery note at checkout. 
 
5.10 Vendor Dashboard 
5.10.1 Overview 
The vendor dashboard is a dedicated interface accessible post-login for approved vendor 
accounts. Mobile-responsive. MVP scope is focused on profile setup, menu management, and 
daily order operations. 
 
5.10.2 MVP Dashboard Modules 
Module                               MVP Features 
Home                                  Today's order count, list of upcoming orders for the next 7 days, any 
days marked Off. 
Menu Manager                    Weekly calendar builder for current week and next week. Per -day, per-
meal-type entry (Lunch and Dinner separately). Each meal slot has: 
name, description, food type (Veg/Non-Veg), photo upload, price (INR). 
Mark full day as Off. Publish/unpublish week. If a day is not published, 
customers see 'Menu not yet published' for that day.  
Today's Orders                    List of all orders for today showing: customer name, phone number, 
delivery address, meal type (Lunch/Dinner), any addons, delivery note. 
'Mark as Dispatched' button per order —  triggers customer WhatsApp + 
email notification. 
Order History                       Past orders by date. View customer details per order.  
Day Off Management           Vendor can mark any future day as Off. If customers have already paid 
for that day, the system automatically credits their wallets in full

5.11 Platform Admin Dashboard 
5.11.1 Overview 
The platform admin dashboard is for internal Dabbaz operators. Accessible only via admin-role 
accounts. MVP scope covers vendor management, customer support, and platform 
configuration. 
 
5.11.2 MVP Admin Modules 
Module                               MVP Features 
Vendor Queue                     Pending onboarding applications with submitted details, documents 
(FSSAI, Govt ID), reCAPTCHA score. Approve / Reject / Request More 
Info actions. Admin can also manually create a vendor account directly.  
Vendor Management            List of all vendors (active, pending, rejected). View vendor profile and 
order history. Suspend or reinstate a vendor.  
User Management                Search users by phone or name. View order history. Issue wallet credits 
(REFUND_COMPLAINT category). Suspend accounts.  
Order Management              View all orders across all vendors and customers. Filter by date, vendor, 
status. Look up a specific order for support resolution.  
Platform Config                    Global settings: Wallet Top-Up Toggle (ON/OFF), Cancellation Fee (flat 
INR amount, e.g. ₹20), Order Freeze Time (default 21:00 IST, 
configurable). Changes take effect immediately.  
 
5.11.3 Phase 2 Admin Features 
The following are deferred to Phase 2: platform metrics dashboard (GMV, active users, 
revenue), vendor payout queue and reconciliation, disputes module, reviews moderation, 
reporting and CSV exports. 
 
5.12 Trial Meal & Referral System (Phase 2 —  Not in MVP) 
Trial meals and the referral system are deferred to Phase 2. In the MVP, cart-based one-off 
ordering already allows users to try a vendor without committing to a subscription. Referral 
codes and reward logic will be added in Phase 2. 
 
5.13 Customer Support & Dispute Flow 
•     Help Centre: A static FAQ page covering common questions: how the cart works, 
cancellation policy, refund policy, how to report a missing delivery. 
----------------Page (10) Break----------------

•     Report an Issue: For MVP, customer contacts support via email (support@dabbaz.in). 
Admin manually investigates and issues REFUND_COMPLAINT wallet credit if 
warranted. 
•     Phase 2: In-app dispute form, vendor response workflow, automated SLA tracking, and 
structured resolution flow are all Phase 2. 
 
5.14 Order Cancellation & Modification 
5.14.1 Day-Level Cancellation by Customer 
•     What can be cancelled: A customer can cancel any individual day's meal from a placed 
cart order —  for example, cancelling Wednesday's lunch from Vendor A while keeping 
all other days active. 
•     Cancellation Window: Cancellation is allowed up to 9:00 PM IST the night before the 
delivery date. After 9:00 PM, that day's delivery is frozen and cannot be cancelled. The 
cutoff time is configurable from admin Platform Config. 
•     Cancellation Credit: On successful cancellation, the customer receives a 
CANCELLATION_CREDIT in their wallet equal to the meal price minus the global 
cancellation fee (e.g., ₹150 meal − ₹20 fee = ₹130 credit). The ₹20 fee is platform 
revenue. 
•     Vendor Visibility: The vendor's dashboard reflects the cancellation —  the cancelled 
order disappears from their next-day delivery list after the 9 PM freeze. Vendors are 
expected to check their dashboard each evening for the next day's confirmed list. 
 
5.14.2 Vendor-Initiated Day Off 
•     Action: Vendor marks a future day as Off from their dashboard. Before confirming, they 
see a count of customers who have paid orders for that day. 
•     Automatic Credit: The system immediately credits every affected customer's wallet with 
the full meal amount as VENDOR_CANCELLATION_CREDIT. No cancellation fee is 
deducted —  the vendor is responsible for the disruption. 
•     Customer Email: Each affected customer receives an email informing them that Vendor 
X is unavailable on that date and that their wallet has been credited. 
•     Scope: In MVP, vendor cancellation applies to the whole day for all customers. 
Individual order cancellation by vendor is a Phase 2 feature. 
 
5.14.3 The 9 PM Order Freeze 
•     What freezes: All orders for the following day are locked at 9:00 PM IST. No customer 
cancellations or modifications are accepted after this point. 
•     What this enables: Vendors can check their finalised delivery list after 9 PM and 
prepare the exact number of meals without uncertainty. 
•     Configurable: The freeze time is a platform config setting (default 21:00 IST). Admin 
can adjust it without a code change.

5.15 Cart with Calendar View 
5.15.1 Overview 
The cart is the primary ordering mechanism in MVP. No login required to add to cart. Account 
creation happens at checkout as a natural part of providing delivery details. 
 
5.15.2 Menu Structure 
•     Per-Day, Per-Meal-Type: Each day on a vendor's menu has two separate slots —  
Lunch and Dinner. Each slot is independently priced. A vendor can publish Lunch only, 
Dinner only, or both for any given day. 
•     Per-Day Pricing: Vendors set the price for each individual meal slot. Different days can 
have different prices —  e.g., ₹150 for weekday lunch, ₹180 for Saturday lunch. 
•     Availability Window: Customers can see the current week and next week's published 
menu. If a day or slot is not yet published, the calendar shows 'Menu not yet published' 
for that slot. 
 
5.15.3 Adding to Cart 
•     Entry Point: On the vendor profile page, the menu is displayed as a two-week calendar. 
Each day shows Lunch and Dinner slots with the meal name, food type badge, and 
price. A meal slot that is published and available has an 'Add' button. Clicking Add adds 
that specific slot (vendor + date + meal type) to the cart. 
•     No Login Required: No authentication needed to add to cart. Cart is stored under a 
session_id in the database. 
•     Multi-Vendor: User can add meals from multiple vendors. Each vendor's items are 
visually grouped in the cart. 
•     Cart Persistence: Cart survives page refreshes and browser closes for up to 7 days. 
Cleared only on successful payment. 
•     Cart Icon: Persistent in navbar showing total item count. Visible on all pages. 
 
5.15.4 Minimum Order Rule 
•     Rule: A minimum of 3 meals must be selected from any single vendor within a calendar 
week (Monday to Sunday) to include that vendor in checkout. Lunch and Dinner count 
together —  2 lunches + 1 dinner from the same vendor = qualifies. 
•     Real-Time Indicator: The cart calendar shows a per-vendor progress bar: 'X of 3 meals 
this week from [Vendor Name]'. 
•     Partial Checkout: If Vendor A qualifies (3+ meals) and Vendor B does not, checkout 
prompts the user to either add more meals from Vendor B or remove Vendor B from the 
order. The user can proceed with qualifying vendors only. 
•     Server-Side Enforcement: The minimum rule is validated again server-side at payment 
confirmation —  not just on the frontend. 
 
5.15.5 Cart Calendar View

•     Layout: Clicking the cart icon opens a calendar slide-over. Days with cart items are 
highlighted. Each highlighted day shows the meal slots added —  vendor name, meal 
name, meal type badge (L/D), price. 
•     Edit & Remove: Each item has a Remove button. The calendar updates in real time. 
•     Summary Footer: Sticky footer with total item count, per-vendor minimum status, 
subtotal, and 'Proceed to Checkout' button. 
 
5.15.6 Checkout Flow 
•     Step 1 —  Vendor Validation: Server checks each vendor meets 3-meal minimum. Non-
qualifying vendors flagged for user action. 
•     Step 2 —  Your Details: If not logged in: user enters Full Name, Mobile Number, 
Delivery Address (Line 1, Line 2, City, PIN Code). OTP sent to mobile. On verify: 
account created or existing user logged in. Cart session merged to account. If already 
logged in: user selects from saved addresses or adds new one. 
•     Step 3 —  Payment: User selects payment method —  Wallet (only if balance ≥ order 
total), Card, or UPI. GST breakdown shown. 'Pay ₹X' button initiates Razorpay. 
•     Post-Payment: Individual Order records created per cart item. Cart cleared. Order 
confirmation email sent to customer. New order notification email sent to each vendor. 
 
 
5.16 How It Works Page 
A public-facing marketing and explainer page accessible without login, linked from the main 
navigation. Its purpose is to explain the Dabbaz model to first-time visitors and reduce drop-off 
from users who do not understand the subscription/tiffin concept. 
 
5.16.1 Page Sections 
•     Hero Section: A headline and subheadline summarising the value proposition (e.g., 
'Fresh home-cooked meals, delivered daily. No cooking. No restaurant prices.'). A 
primary CTA button linking to the discovery page. 
•     How It Works —  3 Steps: Step 1: Browse & discover local tiffin vendors near your office 
or home. Step 2: Pick the days you want —  choose meals from the weekly menu 
calendar, minimum 3 from any vendor. Step 3: Get fresh meals delivered daily. Each 
step has an icon, a heading, and two to three sentences of explanation. 
•     For Customers Section: Explains the cart model —  browse vendor menus, pick 
specific days, pay once. Covers wallet credits, day-level cancellation before 9 PM, and 
what happens when a vendor takes a day off. 
•     For Vendors Section: Brief explainer for home chefs interested in joining. Covers the 
onboarding process, menu calendar, daily order dashboard, and dispatch notifications. 
Ends with a 'Become a Vendor' CTA button. 
•     Trust Section: FSSAI-verified vendors, OTP-verified customers, platform-managed 
secure payments, 9 PM order freeze protecting vendors from last-minute cancellations. 
Displayed as icon + text tiles.

Are vendors home cooks or restaurants? What is the minimum order? 
•     Final CTA: Prominent button linking to the vendor discovery page. 
 
5.16.2 Implementation Notes 
•     This is a fully static page —  no API calls. All content is hardcoded. 
•     It must load fast and render well on mobile —  this is likely the first page many users see. 
•     Link it from: the main navigation bar, the footer, and the vendor listing page's empty 
state. 
 
5.17 Invoice & Receipt 
5.17.1 MVP —  Basic Receipt Email 
•     Trigger: Every successful payment sends an itemised receipt email to the customer via 
Resend within 60 seconds. This is the MVP invoice. 
•     Receipt Contents: Order summary with each meal (vendor name, date, meal type, 
addons), GST breakdown (taxable value at 60%, CGST 2.5%, SGST 2.5%, effective 3% 
total), payment method, Razorpay transaction ID, and total amount charged. Plain email 
layout —  no PDF attachment in MVP. 
•     Vendor Email: Vendor also receives an email listing the new orders just placed by the 
customer. 
 
5.17.2 Phase 2 —  PDF Invoices & Monthly Statements 
The following invoice features are deferred to Phase 2: PDF invoice generation (PDFKit or 
Puppeteer), downloadable invoices on the Payments page, automated consolidated monthly 
statements, admin invoice ledger with resend capability, and vendor settlement invoices. The 
Invoice and GSTRate tables exist in the schema for Phase 2 use. 
 
5.18 GST Compliance 
5.18.1 Applicable Tax Structure 
Dabbaz operates in the food services category under Indian GST. The applicable rule for 
restaurant/food supply services is the composite supply model —  5% GST applies on 60% of 
the invoice value (the remaining 40% is exempt as the notional cost of raw materials). This 
results in an effective GST rate of 3% on the total invoice amount. No Input Tax Credit (ITC) is 
available under this scheme. 
 
5.18.2 Tax Calculation Logic

Amount Before Tax                        Invoice Amount − GST                 ₹194.00 
 
5.18.3 Invoice GST Line Items 
•     HSN/SAC Code: SAC code 996331 (Restaurant services including takeaway) to be 
displayed on all invoices. 
•     Invoice Display: Each invoice must show: subtotal (before tax), taxable value (60% of 
subtotal), CGST (2.5% on taxable value), SGST (2.5% on taxable value), and total. 
CGST and SGST are shown as separate line items as required under Indian GST law. 
•     Vendor GST Number: Vendors who are GST-registered can add their GSTIN to their 
profile. It is displayed on invoices where their meals are included. Vendors who are not 
GST-registered are marked as 'Composition scheme / unregistered' on invoices. 
 
5.18.4 Admin GST Reports —  Phase 2 
Monthly GST summary reports (total taxable value, CGST, SGST collected), CSV export for 
GST filing, and platform commission GST on vendor settlement invoices are all deferred to 
Phase 2. The GSTRate table exists in the schema so rates are configurable without a code 
change when Phase 2 is built. 
 
 
5.19 Collection & Delivery Fulfilment Mode (Phase 2 —  Not in MVP) 
This feature adds Collection as a second fulfilment mode alongside Delivery. Vendors opt in to 
offering collection. Customers choose their mode per vendor at the time of adding to cart. 
Pricing separates the meal base cost from a delivery surcharge, making the economics 
transparent. This is a Phase 2 feature. The schema additions are included now for forward 
compatibility. 
 
5.19.1 Vendor Configuration 
Vendors configure fulfilment from a dedicated Fulfilment tab in their profile settings. 
•     Delivery Charge: A single flat INR delivery charge that applies uniformly across all the 
vendor's meal slots (e.g. ₹20 per delivery event). Not per day and not per meal type —  
one number for the whole vendor. Platform enforces a hard constraint: the delivery 
charge cannot exceed the base meal price. 
•     Collection Toggle: Off by default. When enabled, the vendor unlocks collection-specific 
fields.

•     Collection Addresses: Vendors set a Lunch collection address and a Dinner collection 
address separately. These can differ from the kitchen's registered address and from 
each other —  e.g. 'Society Gate B' for lunch and 'Building lobby entrance' for dinner. 
•     Collection Windows: Vendors set separate time windows for Lunch collection and 
Dinner collection —  e.g. Lunch 12:00–12:45 PM, Dinner 7:30–8:15 PM. 
•     Per-Slot Fulfilment Override: In the menu builder, each day's meal slot can be 
individually set to DELIVERY, COLLECTION, or BOTH, overriding the profile-level 
default. This lets a vendor offer collection-only on days when they cannot arrange 
delivery, without changing their profile. 
 
5.19.2 Dual Capacity Caps (replaces single daily_capacity) 
The existing single daily_capacity field on VendorProfile is superseded by two per-slot capacity 
caps on MenuItem. These are set per meal slot, meaning Lunch and Dinner each have their 
own independent caps. 
•     Max Orders: Maximum number of distinct customer orders accepted for this slot. 
Optional —  leave blank for no limit. 
•     Max Portions: Maximum total tiffin boxes (portions) across all orders for this slot. 
Optional —  leave blank for no limit. 
•     Enforcement Rule: If an add-to-cart action would cause current_orders + 1 to exceed 
max_orders, OR current_portions + quantity to exceed max_portions, the add is blocked. 
Whichever cap is hit first wins. No partial accommodation —  the customer cannot reduce 
quantity to squeeze in. The 'At Capacity' badge appears and the slot accepts no further 
cart additions. 
•     Capacity Reservation —  Option A: Counters (current_orders, current_portions) 
increment at cart-add time and decrement on cart item removal or expiry. This means 
the slot can show 'At Capacity' from cart reservations alone, not just paid orders. This 
protects home vendors from over-commitment. The nightly cart expiry cron (7-day 
cleanup) releases held capacity from abandoned carts automatically. 
•     Checkout Re-validation: When the customer initiates payment (Razorpay order 
creation), the backend re-validates both caps for every cart item before creating the 
Razorpay order. If a slot has since been filled by another customer's reservation, 
checkout is blocked and the customer is told which slot is unavailable —  no payment is 
initiated and no money moves. There is no post-payment capacity check and no post-
payment refund for capacity reasons. 
 
5.19.3 Portions (Quantity per Slot) 
Customers can order more than one portion of the same meal slot —  for example 2 boxes of 
Monday's lunch to share with a colleague at the same office. 
•     Minimum Order Rule Update: The minimum 3 meal units rule is measured in portions, 
not delivery events. 1 slot × 3 portions = 3 units and satisfies the minimum. The spirit is 
that the order must have sufficient value for both vendor and platform. The cart progress 
indicator reads 'X of 3 meal units this week' with a tooltip explaining that each portion 
counts as 1 unit.

•     Cancellation with Portions: Cancellation is all-or-nothing per slot. A customer who 
ordered a slot × 3 portions cancels all 3 at once. Credit = (base price × 3) − one flat 
cancellation fee. Partial portion reduction (cancelling 1 of 3) is a Phase 3 feature.     
•     Vendor Dashboard Display:  Order cards show quantity explicitly: 'Mon 24 Feb Lunch × 
2 —  deliver to [address]' so the vendor knows exactly how many boxes to prepare. 
 
5.19.4 Fulfilment Mode —  Customer Experience 
•     Fulfilment Choice Per Vendor: When a customer adds their first slot from Vendor A, 
they choose deliver everything from Vendor A or collect everything from Vendor A. This 
choice applies to all of Vendor A's meals in their cart. They can mix across vendors —  
collect from Vendor A and deliver from Vendor B simultaneously. 
•     Changing Mode: A 'Change to Collection / Change to Delivery' option on the vendor's 
group in the cart updates all that vendor's items simultaneously. 
•     On the Vendor Profile Page: When a vendor offers BOTH modes, clicking Add on a 
slot expands a selector showing: Deliver to my address (base price + '+ ₹X delivery per 
delivery event') and Collect it myself (base price only, plus collection window and 
address). If the vendor offers only one mode, no choice is presented —  the mode is 
assumed. 
•     At Checkout: If any vendor has Delivery selected, the delivery address input appears as 
normal. If all vendors are Collection, the address input is replaced by collection summary 
cards showing each vendor's collection address and window. Mixed carts show both. 
 
5.19.5 Delivery Charge Calculation 
A delivery event is a unique combination of date × meal type from the same vendor. Delivery 
charge = number of unique delivery events × vendor's flat delivery rate. 
Cart Contents from Vendor A (₹20 delivery 
rate) 
Delivery Events              Delivery Charge 
Feb 23 Lunch × 2 portions                                       1                                    ₹20 
Feb 23 Lunch + Feb 23 Dinner                                 2                                    ₹40 
Feb 23 Lunch + Feb 24 Lunch + Feb 25 Dinner         3                                    ₹60 
Feb 23 Lunch × 3 portions + Feb 24 Lunch × 1 
portion 
2                                    ₹40 
 
5.19.6 Cart Display Format 
The cart and checkout show an itemised per-vendor breakdown (Option A). Delivery charge is a 
separate line under each vendor group, not blended into the meal price. Example for a mixed 
cart: 
•     Vendor A (Delivery): Mon 24 Feb Lunch × 2 = ₹400 | Tue 25 Feb Dinner × 1 = ₹180 | 
Wed 26 Feb Dinner × 1 = ₹180 | Delivery (3 events × ₹20) = ₹60 | Vendor A subtotal = 
₹820 
•     Vendor B (Collection —  12:00–12:45 PM at Gate 2): Mon 24 Feb Lunch × 1 = ₹150 | 
Wed 26 Feb Lunch × 1 = ₹150 | Vendor B subtotal = ₹300

•     Grand Total: Food GST (3% effective) = ₹33 | Delivery GST (18% on ₹60) = ₹11 | 
Grand total = ₹1,164 
 
5.19.7 GST on Delivery Charge 
•     Food Price GST: Composite supply, effective 3% as per current spec (SAC 996331). 
•     Delivery Charge GST: 18% standard rate (9% CGST + 9% SGST) as applicable under 
Indian GST for delivery services. Shown as a separate line item on the receipt and 
invoice. The GSTRate table stores both rates —  no new infrastructure required. 
 
5.19.8 No-Show on Collection Orders 
If a customer selects collection but does not arrive to collect their tiffin, the order is treated as 
complete from the vendor's side. The vendor is paid and no automatic refund is issued. 
Customers who believe there are exceptional circumstances can contact Dabbaz support —  
resolution is manual and at admin discretion. This policy is stated clearly in the FAQ and at the 
point of selecting collection mode. 
 
5.19.9 Vendor Order Dashboard Changes 
•     Deliveries Section: Order cards show customer name, phone, delivery address, meal 
name, quantity (× N), addons, delivery note. Action: 'Mark as Dispatched' —  fires 
WhatsApp + email as currently specced. 
•     Collections Section: Separate section on the daily orders page. Cards show customer 
name, phone, meal name, quantity (× N), and collection window reminder. Action: 'Mark 
as Ready for Collection' —  fires a notification to the customer: 'Your tiffin from [Vendor 
Name] is ready. Collect by [end time] at [collection address].' 
•     Collection Status Flow: PREPARING → READY_FOR_COLLECTION. A future 
COLLECTED status can be added in Phase 3 if vendors want to confirm pickup 
happened. 
 
5.19.10 Discovery Page Filter 
A single additional checkbox on the discovery page filter panel: 'Offers Collection'. Filters to 
vendors where collection_enabled = true. One boolean WHERE clause —  minimal complexity. 
Included from Phase 2 launch. 
 
5.19.11 Schema Changes for Phase 2 
•     VendorProfile additions: delivery_charge (Decimal, nullable), collection_enabled 
(Boolean default false), collection_address_lunch (String?), collection_address_dinner 
(String?), collection_lunch_window_start (String?), collection_lunch_window_end 
(String?), collection_dinner_window_start (String?), collection_dinner_window_end 
(String?). The existing daily_capacity field is retained for backward compatibility but 
superseded by per-slot caps.

6. UX & Design Principles 
Brand guidelines will be provided separately. The following principles apply regardless of the 
final visual language: 
•     Mobile-First: All user-facing pages must be fully functional at 375px viewport width. The 
vendor dashboard can prioritize tablet/desktop but must not break on mobile. 
•     Progressive Disclosure: Show users only what they need at each step. Subscription 
details, addons, and delivery preferences are revealed progressively —  not all at once. 
•     Zero-Friction Discovery: Users must be able to browse vendor listings and menus 
without creating an account. Account creation is required only at checkout. 
•     Trust Signals: FSSAI badge, verified phone badge, review count, and delivery area are 
displayed prominently on vendor cards. These are non-negotiable layout elements. 
•     Clear Empty States: When vendors haven't published a menu, or a user has no 
upcoming orders, show helpful empty state copy with a clear next action. 
•     Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum. Adequate colour contrast, keyboard 
navigation, screen reader labels. 
 
 
7. Technical Architecture Considerations 
7.1 Confirmed Stack 
•     Frontend: React.js (Vite) with TailwindCSS. Separate repository from backend. Mobile-
responsive SPA. Note: as a SPA, vendor profile pages will not be server-side rendered 
—  SEO for public listing pages should be addressed in Phase 2 (e.g., via a lightweight 
SSR layer or pre-rendering service). 
•     Backend: Node.js with Express.js. RESTful API served separately from the frontend. 
CORS configured to accept requests from the frontend domain only. 
•     Database: MySQL hosted on Azure Database for MySQL (Flexible Server). Prisma 
used as the ORM for type-safe queries and schema migrations. Note: MySQL does not

support native array column types —  fields like cuisine_tags, delivery_pincodes, and 
photo_urls are stored as JSON columns. 
•     File Storage: Azure Blob Storage for vendor photos, menu images, and FSSAI/KYC 
documents. Private containers for sensitive documents (signed URL access); public 
containers for food/profile photos. 
•     Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications. Resend or 
SendGrid for transactional email. MSG91 for SMS OTP. 
•     Auth: Passport.js with Google OAuth 2.0 strategy and JWT (access + refresh tokens). 
Sessions managed via signed JWTs stored in httpOnly cookies. 
•     Background Jobs: Bull queue (backed by Redis on Azure Cache for Redis) for the 
nightly order freeze cron job, cart expiry cleanup, notification dispatch, and wallet credit 
processing on vendor day-off. Phase 2 will add subscription billing and payout 
processing jobs. 
•     Deployment: Frontend on Azure Static Web Apps. Backend on Azure App Service 
(Node.js). Database on Azure Database for MySQL. File storage on Azure Blob Storage. 
•     Payments: Razorpay for India —  UPI, Card, Net Banking. Razorpay Route for vendor 
payout splits is a Phase 2 configuration pending the platform payment model decision. 
•     reCAPTCHA: Google reCAPTCHA v3 on vendor onboarding submission, verified 
server-side. 
 
7.2 Security Requirements 
•     All API endpoints must be authenticated via JWT middleware (except public 
listing/browse and auth endpoints). 
•     Vendor documents stored in private Azure Blob Storage container —  accessed only via 
short-lived SAS (Shared Access Signature) URLs generated server-side. 
•     PII fields (phone, bank account number, IFSC) encrypted at the application layer before 
database write using AES-256. 
•     All user inputs validated with express-validator or Zod on the backend. Prisma 
parameterised queries prevent SQL injection by default. 
•     Payment data never stored on Dabbaz servers —  tokenised via Razorpay. 
•     CORS strictly configured: only frontend domain and admin subdomain whitelisted. 
•     Admin API routes protected by both JWT auth and an ADMIN role middleware guard. 
 
7.3 Architecture Notes 
•     Two separate deployments: React SPA (static) and Node.js API (dynamic). Frontend 
calls backend via a versioned base URL (e.g., api.dabbaz.in/v1/). 
•     MySQL JSON columns (cuisine_tags, delivery_pincodes, photo_urls, tags) should be 
queried carefully —  avoid full-table JSON scans. For filtering by pincode or cuisine, 
maintain a normalised join table alongside the JSON column for query performance. 
•     Menu calendar queries: index the MenuItem table on (vendor_id, date, meal_type) for 
fast daily order lookups. 
•     Subscription billing and payout processing must run in a Bull queue worker process, not 
in an API route handler.

•     Delivery status polling: frontend polls GET /orders/today every 60 seconds. For Phase 2 
consider WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to push status updates.

10. Open Questions & Decisions Pending 
•     OQ-1 Brand & Design: Brand guidelines to be provided. All color tokens, typography, 
and icon sets are placeholders pending brand handoff. 
•     OQ-2 Payment Model (Critical): Whether Dabbaz aggregates payments (platform 
collects from customer, distributes to vendors) or facilitates direct payments (customer 
pays vendor directly) has significant legal and operational implications —  payment 
aggregator licence, GST liability, TDS on vendor payouts. Decision pending a separate 
business/legal review. Current implementation assumes platform-collected payments. 
•     OQ-3 WhatsApp Provider: Interakt or Wati recommended for WhatsApp Business API 
integration. Pre-approved message templates must be submitted to Meta before launch. 
Typical approval: 24–48 hours. Set this up early —  do not leave it for launch week. 
•     OQ-4 KYC Depth: Is FSSAI + Government ID sufficient for vendor verification, or do we 
require a live selfie/video step for higher trust? FSSAI + Govt ID is the MVP default. 
•     OQ-5 Vendor Onboarding Fee: Optional INR 99–499 refundable application fee as a 
spam deterrent. Decision pending. 
•     OQ-6 GST Compliance: Vendors below the GST registration threshold (INR 20L annual 
turnover) are exempt. Platform-level GST handling and invoice requirements need legal 
review before launch. GST module is Phase 2 in the build but legal clarity is needed 
before MVP goes live. 
•     OQ-7 Cart Expiry Notification: When a cart item expires after 7 days, should the 
customer receive an email/WhatsApp notification? Recommended: yes, but requires the 
customer to have a phone number on file —  only possible if they are already registered. 
•     OQ-8 Delivery Freeze Edge Case: If a vendor marks a day as Off after 9 PM (e.g., 
emergency the night before), the system should still process the vendor cancellation and

this asymmetry acceptable? Recommended: yes —  vendor emergencies override the
